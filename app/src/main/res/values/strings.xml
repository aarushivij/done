        To make sure that your goal is motivating, write down why it\'s valuable and important to you.
        Ask yourself, \"If I were to share my goal with others, what would I tell them to convince them it was a worthwhile goal?\"
        You can use this motivating value statement to help you if you start to doubt yourself or lose confidence in your ability to actually make the goal happen.
